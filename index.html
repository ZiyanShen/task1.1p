           <p>I  work on a robot that can help society or the environment, so that robots can help humans in a real sense.It snows in many countries around the world and the roads are very unsafe afterwards, so I want to design a robot that can automatically remove snow to help humans.I designed a robot that automatically clears snow according to the lines on the road，This uses the methods learnt on the Line follower sensor，When the snowplows is in motion the ultrasonic sensors can be used depending on the distance to the snow, when the distance between the vehicle and the snow is Less than than 50 cm the snowplows Start collecting snowballs，When snow is detected (my design is a variety of coloured balls, so I use a colour sensor) the robot automatically shovels up the snow for five seconds and then releases the shovel，It will continue to do all the snow clearing automatically and then return to its designated place, partly as a result of the artificial intelligence part of the study.So I designed this automatic snow ploughing robot to help people.</p>
